Flutter is an open-source app development framework created by Google. It allows for the creation of high-performance native applications for iOS, Android, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language, also developed by Google, known for its efficiency and performance. With Flutter, developers can create expressive and flexible user interfaces using a declarative approach, making it easy to create custom and responsive widgets.
